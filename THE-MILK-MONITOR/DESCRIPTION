Potentiometer linked to milk bottle or located on front of fridge,
so that everytime milk is taken the dial is turned the amount taken.

Flatmates can view on their devices the amount left (potentiometer serial monitor figures)
and know when they need to buy more. 

Potentially, when a certain reading was reached this could be improved to actually 
text flatmates in rotation, so they know they need more milk and that it's their turn to buy it.
