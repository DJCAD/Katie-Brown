Number of LED's linked to board would be the number of windows in your house, if they are all running in sequence your windows
are all shut in the house.

When an LED goes off and the sequence is broken, it means the window has been opened and you can check to see which windows are 
open in your house to make sure they are shut again later on. The aim would be to remind you to close windows before leaving home
or to help you control temperature of house and be more economic when heating rooms when a window is open.  


(this would need to be linked to a tilt switch or other stimulus on the window. More an example of how a sequence of lights could 
affect behaviours and improve function of windows.)
